Implementing TCP-like data transport protocol using UDP.
Computer Networks (CC451) project 1.


### TODO

#### Algorithms
- [x] Stop-and-Wait
- [ ] Selective Repeat
- [ ] GoBackN
#### 
- [ ] Packet header
- [ ] Handle timeout
- [ ] Server handles multiple client connections
- [ ] Checksum

#### Lost and Corrupt Packets Simulation
- [ ] Lost packets
- [ ] Corrupt packets

#### File processing
- [ ] client.in
- [ ] server.in

#### Network System Analysis
- [ ] Script to generate runs

Comparison of algorithms with PLP 1%, 5%, 10%, 30%, report average of at least 5 consecutive runs

#### Bonus
- [ ] Packet-sniffing with wireshark
- [ ] Checksum
